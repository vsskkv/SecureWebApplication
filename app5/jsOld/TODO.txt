Hi Tom, 

Sorry to disturb you on your holidays but the marks we attained on our group assignment wasn't consistent among the members. I scored a mark of 75%, whilst another team member got a mark in the 80s percentile and one group member named Adam Osman received no mark at all for the same submission. Even though the difference in marks isnt that great, I am worried about my performance in the exam and the coursework mark would help ease those worries.

Kind Regards

Hi Tom,  I've just received an email regarding my progression next year to chemical engineering. I wanted to ask if it was due to the maths paper written on the 12/05/17. There was an issue with my candidate number and I would like to know if this affected the grade that I will receive. If this is not the case would further clarification about my exam paper and its grade be possible please.

Hi Tom
I'm struggling to understand if maths was the reason why i didnt progress into my desired course, then why cant i just resit the exam. You also mentioned in a previous email that i can have something called a referred entry
