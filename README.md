# SecureWebApplication

## Made using:

- [AMP] Apache | MySql | PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- .Js

## Brief:

Simple website hosted using basic AMPP server. This site used Bootstrap to format the page. 

### Step1:
Set up AMPPS whitch is a serverside hosting service to view files locally. Also i used vscode to edit the files since its streamline and light weight. The way i added the files to the web hosting server is by using a file transfer protocol called file zilla, this is a client version where i can connect to the host and send my files there so its hosted. For the actual hosting i used 000webhost.com, this is a free simple hosting site that hosted the file for the program/app.
