# SecureWebApplication

## Made using:

- [AMP] Apache | MySql | PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- .Js

## Brief:

Simple website hosted using basic AMPP server. This site used Bootstrap to format the page. 

### Step 1:
Set up AMPPS whitch is a serverside hosting service to view files locally. Also i used vscode to edit the files since its streamline and light weight. The way i added the files to the web hosting server is by using a file transfer protocol called file zilla, this is a client version where i can connect to the host and send my files there so its hosted. For the actual hosting i used 000webhost.com, this is a free simple hosting site that hosted the file for the program/app.  

### Step 2:
To Start the projecct i had to firest start my linux server system [AMPPS] for this i made sure that Apache and MySQL is running so i can 1 host the site and 2 start making a my sql database. After i had to start writing some code. The code is basic HTML code with in page JavaScript using the tag <script> </script>. Inside the tags was a like function to loop through a array of a arrays and display the infomation in a table form using the tags for a table but inside .js by printing the table tags inside the html page.
